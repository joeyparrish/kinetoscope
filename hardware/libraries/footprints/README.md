# KiCad footprints

These are used in the Kinetoscope hardware design, but are not a part of
KiCad's standard library of footprints.

- `kinetoscope-cart-header.pretty`
  - Pin headers for stacking the boards of Kinetoscope.
  - Made with love, by hand.
- `MD-CART-FINGERS.pretty/MD-CART-FINGERS.kicad_mod`
  - Sega Genesis / Mega Drive cartridge edge connector.
  - Taken from the Doragasu library at
    https://github.com/doragasu/doragasu-kicad-lib
  - Also used in the MegaWiFi cart at https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw-cart
  - Modified to include a basic board outline at the correct width.
