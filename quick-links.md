# Kinetoscope Quick Links

Got here from a QR code in a lightning talk?  I bet Joey didn't have enough time and/or space to give a lot of meaningful links.  Here are a few good starting points to choose from:

 * [Source code](https://github.com/joeyparrish/kinetoscope)
 * [Web-based emulator/demo](https://joeyparrish.github.io/kinetoscope/)
 * [14-minute tech talk on YouTube](https://youtu.be/0Atlf_whVgA)
