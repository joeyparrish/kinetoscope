# Kinetoscope Quick Links

Got here from a QR code in a talk?  I bet Joey didn't have enough time and/or space to give a lot of meaningful links.  Here are a few to choose from:

 * [All source code](https://github.com/joeyparrish/kinetoscope) (player, encoder, firmware, and board designs)
 * [Web-based emulator/demo](https://joeyparrish.github.io/kinetoscope/)
 * [14-minute tech talk on YouTube](https://youtu.be/0Atlf_whVgA)
 * [Slide viewer source](https://github.com/joeyparrish/sega-slides)
 * [Font (Kode Mono)](https://github.com/isaozler/kode-mono)
